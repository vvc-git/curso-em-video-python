# Python Programming Course by Gustavo Guanabara

Welcome to this repository! Here you'll find my solutions to the exercises from the Python programming course offered by Curso em Video, led by Gustavo Guanabara.

## About the Course

This course was a significant milestone in my programming journey, as it marked not only my first experience with Python but also my initial exposure to programming as a whole. The course was undertaken during the 2020 pandemic, a time when my Computer Science classes at UFSC were suspended due to the global crisis.

## Learning Experience

During this self-taught endeavor, I delved into fundamental programming concepts such as:

- Strings
- Lists
- Tuples
- Functions
- For
- While
- Matrix
- Sets
- Dictionaries
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

These lessons provided a solid foundation in Python and programming principles, which have been invaluable in my ongoing studies and projects.
